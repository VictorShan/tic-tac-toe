To play, enter a lobby ID to create or enter a lobby. Lobbies will be recycled after 3 hours.
Another player must also enter the same lobby ID to join your game. Once they enter, the game starts.
There is no indicator for whether or not the opponent is still there. This feature will be added soon.

Once the game ends, players will need to create a new lobby to play again.

Players must be on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) or different devices to play against each other.


## Future Features
- Automatic matchmaking
- Simple AI to play against
- Replay/multiple matches per lobby
- Mobile friendly
